# LetsUpgrade-Control-Statements-Assignment
In this C program;
1. We will take two integers as input and store it in the variables num1 and num2 respectively

2. Using if-else statements check we will if num1 is equal to num2

3. If they are equal, then print the output as “num1 and num2 are equal”

4. Otherwise print the output as “num1 and num2 are not equal”
